# 📖 Overview

**ProactiveMobile** is the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate **proactive intelligence in mobile agents**.

Unlike traditional reactive benchmarks that measure instruction-following ability, ProactiveMobile evaluates whether models can:

- Anticipate latent user intent  
- Reason over multi-source contextual signals  
- Generate executable API call sequences  
- Avoid unnecessary or unsafe triggers  

The benchmark includes:

- 📱 14 real-world mobile scenarios  
- 📊 3,600+ annotated instances  
- 🔧 63 executable API functions  
- 🎯 Multi-answer annotations  
- 🛡 Safety-aware evaluation protocol  

This repository provides:

- Official dataset splits  
- Training and inference scripts  
- Evaluation toolkit  
- Baseline reproduction scripts
